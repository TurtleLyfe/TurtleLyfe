 Some important notes: 

- Main languages are **C++** and **C#** *(working on two languages at once, how silly)*; I have dabbled in a bit of **Java**, **Javascript**, **HTML/CSS** and *(in a very small amount)* **assembly**.. but these are extremely limited, so I'm not useful there.
- Fluent in English and the only language I speak/write in, *so if I cannot understand your language I apologise; I haven't done much else..* 
- Currently messing around with several programs and looking for my next project. •>•

  *(Oh, and my turtle says 'Hello' too.)*
